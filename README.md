## Overview üöÄ

[Solvr](https://solvr.in) is a helpful, web-based tool for practicing and reviewing Cambridge IGCSE multiple-choice questions. It supports subjects like **Economics**, **Chemistry**, **Biology**, **Physics**, and even **French** (with listening audio support!). With Solvr, you can:

- Load past paper PDFs alongside answer options  
- Track time with a built-in timer (with pause/resume and ‚Äú+15 Min‚Äù button)  
- Flag or unflag questions to revisit them  
- Automatically check answers and calculate your score  
- Review only wrong questions in a special ‚ÄúReview‚Äù mode  
- Seamlessly handle partial-credit scenarios (e.g., French multi-select items)  
- Enjoy a minimal, dark-themed UI with color-coded options for clarity 

*(No major updates expected until **March 2025**, as I'm busy with my IGCSEs.)*
